2)pvdisplay /dev/sdc1
3)pvcreate /dev/sdc1
4) same 2 and 3 steps for second partition
5)vgcreate vg1 /dev/sdc1 /dev/sdd1
6)vgdisplay
7)lvcreate --size [size] --name mylv1 vg1
8) lvdisplay
9)lvextend --size +1G /dev/vg1/mylv1  : to extend the size of partition.
10)resize2fs /dev/vg1/mylv1  :for formattng without removing the data.

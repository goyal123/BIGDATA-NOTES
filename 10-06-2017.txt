LINUX

*****

*there is a '/' folder in linux which is  a parentfolder. for eg /root/Desktop :this means desktop is in root folder and and root is in '/' folder.
* kernel program which is preent in the os calls the driver of any hardware when it is attached to the system so that it can work.
*HAL - HARDWARE ABSTRACTION LAYER: used for detecting external storage
*USB port is technically also known as SCSI port
commands
--------
fdisk -l : to check all the attached storage in the system
bc : to open the calculator
udevadm monitor : the signals which are coming through usb.it will captute that.
mount /dev/sdb1  /media/eric  : to mount a partition to eric folder so that it shows as a drive on the desktop.because path consit 'media'.
df -hT : to display the file formats of the partition
blkid : complete details about the partitions.

**steps for deleting a partition in pendrive
1.fdisk
2.insert pendrive
3.fdisk
4.fdisk -l /dev/sdb
5.p:print
6.df -h : to check if drive is mounted or not
7 fdisk /dev/sdb
8)d
9)p
10.)partprobe /dev/sdb ON ROOT :informs the kernel for partion table changes


**steps for Creating a partition in pendrive
1) create a partition in the pendrive
2)load the driver in root using partprobe /dev/sdc1
3)format using mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc1
4)mkdir  /media/test
5) mount /dev/sdd1  /media/test
6)e2label /dev/sdc1  new










PYTHON
******


*in python3 everything is object/class, even a datatype.
*in python2 print "hi" and in python3 print("hi")
*no raw_input function in python. so input() is used to take the input
*in python2 input() takes every input as a expression.whereas raw_input take everything as a string input.
*in python3 input() takes every input as a string.



keywords
--------
**eval("5+2") :it is used to calculate mathemaical calculations.
**import sys
sys.ps1("  ")   : to change the prompt name
**import getpass
getpass.getpass()







code:: python3								code:python2
------									-------------
	input			output				input						output
>>print("hi" ,end="**")  ::: hi****
>>eval("5+2+3")            ::: 10










BIG DATA
*********

*by default 3replica of data at every node in hadoop

commands:
hadoop fs -put my.txt  / : uploading a file into  / folder
netstat -tnlp : to see all the busy network ports


formation of cluster : master
1)jps
2)cd /etc/hadoop
3)mkdir /master
3)open the hdfs-site.xml and change the code
 <configuration>
<property>
<name>dfs.name.dir</name>
<value>/master</value>
</property
</configuration>
4)hadoop namenode -format
5)hadoop-daemon.sh start namenode
6)hadoop dfsadmin -reports
